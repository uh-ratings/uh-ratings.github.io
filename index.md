## Overview

_**The problem**_: Many students have a hard time deciding whether or not to take a certain class. Or they might be curious about a certain class and may feel intimidated or unprepared. Students do not want to waste tuition money on a class that they might not enjoy or learn from.

_**The solution**_: A class review platform that allows UH students to review and submit posted reviews of offered classes. These reviews may help students to gauge their ‘readiness’ and whether or not they feel that that class will benefit their career. These reviews include but are not limited to class content, textbooks usage and practicality. In terms of application structure and collections: the class number (class code) will serve as the primary key.
